# 🧠 InSightAI - Image Classification Using CNN

**InSightAI** is a deep learning-based image classification system developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. It enables users to upload any image, which is resized to 32x32 pixels and classified into one of 10 categories such as airplane, cat, dog, truck, etc.

The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing a visually interactive and responsive UI. Users can view prediction results, class-wise probabilities, and confidence scores, all enhanced with **Plotly** gauge charts and **Lottie** animations. Theme toggling and recent prediction history are also included for better usability.
